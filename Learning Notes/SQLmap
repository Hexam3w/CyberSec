<SQLmap>

SQLmap is an automated tool created to detect and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web apps.

SQLmap has a wizard that allows us to get guided instead of having to insert all the flags manually.
To use the wizard we use the command: sqlmap --wizard

--dbs -> extract DB names
Databasename --tables - Extract table names

if the application uses a get parameters in the url we can test that url in SQLmap. example.com/search?dog=1 (dog=1 is the get parameter)
