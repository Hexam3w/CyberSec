>Nmap<

Is a network scanner tool that identifies live hosts on the network and finds what services they are running and in what ports and their versions.

Ideally we want to run Nmap as root so we are not limited

>Host Discovery<

Who is online?

Nmap has many ways to specify its target searchs

IP range using a - example 192.168.0.1-10
IP Subnet using / 192.168.0.1/24
Hostname using example.com

We can use the command -SN to scan and find live devices on the network. It works similar to ping

This command will retrieve the live devices and if in the local network the network cards vendors that can give us precious information to the type of target (Since we can send ARP requests)

>Scanning a remote Network<

Since we are more than 1 router away we cannot send ARP requests.

>List Scan<

Command -SL  - we can use this command to tell Nmap to list all the target we want to scan before we scan them so we can confirm them.

>Port Scanning<

Who is listening?

>CONNECT SCAN<

We can do a connect scan using the Command -sT

Nmap will try to connect and if the port is open it will do the 3way handshake followed by a disconnect by the target.
If the port is closed a RST-ACK will be received with no 3way handshake

>Syn Scan (Stealth)<

Command -sS

This type of scan will only send the SYN packet and not the ACK packet so it will not establish a connection.
This is considered a stealth scan since it it lead to less logs.
The conversation should be like this: SYN (Host) -> SYN/ACK (server) -> RST (Host)

>Scanning UDP ports<

Command -sU

We know if a port is closed if we receive a ICMP packet with destination unreachable

>Limiting the Target Ports<

Nmap scans the most common 1000 ports by default.

Commands:
-F -Fast mode and scans only the 100 most common
-p[range] allows to specify a range of ports to be scanned example: -p10-1024

>Version Detection<

>OS Detection<

Command -O this enables OS detection
It relies on multiple indicators to make an educated guess on the OS

There is no perfect detection

>Service and Version Detection<

Command -sV

this command checks the version of the service running on an open port.

>OS+Version+Traceroute+More<

This command combines a lot of commands into one: -A

>Forcing the Scan<

Sometimes hosts will not reply to ICMP requests which leads to nmap marking it as down.
We can tell nMap to port scan and treat all hosts as online by adding the command -Pn

>How Fast is Fast<
With Nmap we can control the Scan speed to avoid being detected by IDS.
Nmap has 5 Speeds: Paranoid 0, Sneaky 1, Polite 2, Normal 3, Agressive 4, Insane 5

We can pick these speeds by using the command -T Number -T Profile Name (-t0 or -T Paranoid)

Example scan for nmap -sS IP -F

Timing 	Total Duration
T0 (paranoid) 	9.8 hours
T1 (sneaky) 	27.53 minutes
T2 (polite) 	40.56 seconds
T3 (normal) 	0.15 seconds
T4 (aggressive) 	0.13 seconds

>Helpfull options<

Commands:
Define the maximum number of probes sent by Nmap in paralel
--min-parallelism <numprobes> Defines the minimum of paralel service probes that nmap can do simultaneouly.
--max-parallelism <numprobes> Defines the Maximum of paralel service probes that nmap can do simultaneouly.

Controls the number of packets per second Nmap can send.
--min-rate <number>
--max-rate <number>

This option defines the maximum time we are willing to wait. Used on slow hosts
--host-timeout <time>

>Output: Controlling what to see<

>How to show more info while performing a scan<
We can use the command -v to enable verbose during a scan This way we can se what is happening in real time
We can increase the verbosity by adding another v up to -vvvv or pressing v after the scan has started.
Another way to do this isnted of -vvvv is -v4

If this is not enough we can go into debuggin level by using -d up to -d4


>Choose scan file format in case we save it<
We can save scan reports by using the following commands


    -oN <filename> - Normal output
    -oX <filename> - XML output
    -oG <filename> - grep-able output (useful for grep and awk)
    -oA <basename> - Output in all major formats
