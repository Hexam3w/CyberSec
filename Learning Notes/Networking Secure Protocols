# TLS, HTTPS, SSH, and Related Protocols

## TLS (Transport Layer Security)

TLS allows secure communication over an insecure network by encrypting data packets.

- Operates at the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**.
- Many modern protocols use TLS, including **HTTPS**, **SMTPS**, **POP3S**, and **IMAPS**.
- TLS certificates are used to verify the authenticity of a server.

## HTTPS (HTTP over TLS)

HTTPS works by:

1. Establishing a TCP 3-way handshake  
2. Establishing a TLS session  
3. Communicating using the HTTP protocol

- TLS encrypts all HTTP data.
- Without the encryption key, the data sent or received cannot be read.
- Uses a different port than HTTP: **port 443** (HTTPS) instead of **port 80** (HTTP).

## SMTPS, POP3S, IMAPS

These are secure versions of email protocols that work similarly to HTTPS:

- They also use **TLS** for encryption.
- They operate on **different ports** than their insecure counterparts.

## SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH was created to improve security when connecting to a server.

### Benefits:

- **Secure Authentication**: Supports password, public key, and two-factor authentication.
- **Confidentiality**: Provides end-to-end encryption, and alerts users about changes in server keys to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that the data has not been altered during transmission.
- **Tunneling**: Can create a secure tunnel to route other protocols, similar to a VPN.
- **X11 Forwarding**: Allows the use of graphical applications over a network on Unix-like systems.

- **SSH uses port 22**.
- **Common command**:  
  ```bash
  ssh username@hostname

## SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

- Uses the **SSH** protocol.  
- Operates on **port 22**.

## FTPS (FTP Secure)

- Uses the **TLS** protocol, similar to HTTPS.  
- Operates on **port 990**.  
- Requires a certificate.  
- Can be tricky to set up behind strict firewalls.

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A VPN is a way of connecting computers in geographically distant locations to the same network.

**Example**: Connecting a PC in Branch A to the network in Branch B.
