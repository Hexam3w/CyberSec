>Gobuster<

It enumerates web Directories, DNS subdomains, vhosts, Amazon S3 Buckets and Google Cloud Storage
Does it via brute force using wordlists.
Gobuster is between reconnaissance and scanning phases.

Enumeration
Gobuster enumerates web directories

Brute force
Gobuster uses lists for this purpose

Example Command

gobuster dir -u "http://www.example.com/" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -t 64

dir - directory and enumeration mode

-u target url

-w wordlist directory

-t number of threads


>Directory and File Enumeration<

We can use this to enumerate a website directories and their files.

Good when we want to see the website directory structure and what files it has available.

Websites directories usually follow a particular convention making them susceptible to brute force attacks.

Go buster scans the website and analises the status codes telling us if we can access certain directories or not.

We can include multiple different flags with the dir command for an extensive list visit gobuster dir --help
Here are the more common ones:

Flag 	Long Flag 	Description
-c 	--cookies 	This flag configures a cookie to pass along each request, such as a session ID.
-x 	--extensions 	This flag specifies which file extensions you want to scan for. E.g., .php, .js
-H 	--headers 	This flag configures an entire header to pass along with each request.
-k 	--no-tls-validation 	This flag  skips the process that checks the certificate when https is used. It often happens for CTF events or test rooms like the ones on THM a self-signed certificate is used. This causes an error during the TLS check.
-n 	--no-status 	You can set this flag when you don’t want to see status codes of each response received. This helps keep the output on the screen clear.
-P 	password 	You can set this flag together with the --username flag to execute authenticated requests. This is handy when you have obtained credentials from a user.
-s 	--status-codes 	With this flag, you can configure which status codes of the received responses you want to display, such as 200, or a range like 300-400.
-b 	--status-codes-blacklist 	This flag allows you to configure which status codes of the received responses you don’t want to display. Configuring this flag overrides the -s flag.
-U 	--username 	You can set this flag together with the --password flag to execute authenticated requests. This is handy when you have obtained credentials from a user.
-r	--followredirect	This flags configures Gobuster to follow the redirect that it received as a response to the sent request. A HTTP redirect status code (e.g., 301 or 302) is used to redirect the client to a different URL.


Minimum commands to run dir:

gobuster dir -u "http://www.example.com" -w /path/to/wordlist

>Subdomain Enumeration<

We can use this to bruteforce subdomains
Something that is patched in the regular domain may not be patched in the subdomain.

We can include multiple different flags with the dns command for an extensive list visit gobuster dns --help

Most common flags:

Flag 	Long Flag 	Description

-c	--show-cname Show CNAME Records (cannot be used with the -i flag).

-I --show-ips Including this flag shows IP addresses that the domain and subdomains resolve to.

-r --resolver This flag configures a custom DNS server to use for resolving.

-d --domain This flag configures the domain you want to enumerate.

Minimum commands to run dns: 

gobuster dns -d example.com -w /path/to/wordlist


>Vhost Enumeration<

This mode allows gobuser to bruteforce virtual hosts.

Virtual hosts are different websites on the same machine they may look like subdomains but they are IP based 

Gobuster scans differently for subdomains (DNS) and for Vhosts (vhost)

vhost mode - will combine the hostname (-u flag) with an entry from the wordlist
dns mode - will do a DNS lookup to the FQDN by combining the domain name (-d flag) with wordlist

To view all vhost flags do gobuster vhost --help

Minimum command: 

gobuster vhost -u "http://example.thm" -w /path/to/wordlist

-u <ip> - We want to use this command with an IP because we are targeting a server
--domain - Since we are targeting a server that can have multiple websites then we want to use this flag to target the top level and second level domains ( --domain test.com)

--append-domain - if this flag is not set it will not add the domain above to the entry in the wordlist and will only send the wordlist causing all types of issues

--exclude-length - we can use this tag to filter false positives. Sometimes we should nonetheless run withtout this and make sure we are getting all the results. THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS!
