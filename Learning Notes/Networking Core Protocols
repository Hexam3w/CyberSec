# DNS 

DNS operates at the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** of the ISO OSI model.

**Ports used:**  
- UDP 53  
- TCP 53  

## DNS Records

# WHOIS

The `whois` command allows you to view domain ownership information that is legally required to be provided by the domain owner. This may include:

- Name
- Address
- Phone number
- Other relevant information

This data can be hidden using domain privacy services.  
**Failure to disclose required information may result in the loss of the domain.**

# HTTP / HTTPS

Used by browsers to communicate with web servers.

**Ports used:**  
- TCP 80 (HTTP)  
- TCP 443 (HTTPS)  
- Sometimes: 8080, 8443  

## Common HTTP Methods

- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server (e.g., an HTML page or image).  
- **POST**: Submits new data to the server (e.g., form submission or file upload).  
- **PUT**: Creates or updates a resource on the server.

# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

- `PASS`: Enter the password  
- `RETR`: Download a file from the FTP server  
- `STOR`: Upload a file to the FTP server

# SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

- `MAIL FROM`: Specifies the sender’s email address  
- `RCPT TO`: Specifies the recipient’s email address  
- `DATA`: Indicates that the client will begin sending the message body

# POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)

# IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

IMAP allows email synchronization across multiple devices. Actions like reading or deleting a message are mirrored across all connected clients.

> IMAP generally uses more storage than POP3 since messages are kept on the server.

## Common IMAP Commands

- `LOGIN <username> <password>`: Authenticates the user  
- `SELECT <mailbox>`: Selects a mailbox (folder) to work with  
- `FETCH <message_number> <data_item>`: Retrieves message content (e.g., `FETCH 3 BODY[]`)
