# Wireshark Overview

Wireshark is one of the best traffic analysis tools available.

## Uses

- Detect and troubleshoot network issues  
- Detect security anomalies  
- Investigate and learn protocol details  

> **Note:** Wireshark does not detect intrusions on its own. It is up to the analyst’s skills to detect any anomalies.

---

## Colouring Packets

Wireshark allows you to customize the colouring of certain packets based on conditions.  
This helps identify problems quickly and locate specific packets.

- Colouring can be applied **permanently** or **temporarily**.

---

## Merge PCAP Files

To merge files:

- Go to `File -> Merge`

---

## View File Details

Sometimes we need to identify the file we're working with for various reasons.

- Navigate to `Statistics -> Capture File Properties`  
- Or click the **pen and paper** icon in the bottom-left corner.

---

## Packet Dissection (AKA Protocol Dissection)

Investigating packet details by understanding protocols and their fields.  
You can even build custom scripts for deeper analysis.

### Packet Layers (based on the OSI model)

- **Frame (Layer 1):** Physical layer details.
- **Source MAC (Layer 2):** Source and destination MAC addresses (Data Link layer).
- **Source IP (Layer 3):** Source and destination IPv4 addresses (Network layer).
- **Protocol (Layer 4):** Protocol used (TCP/UDP), source/destination ports (Transport layer).
- **Protocol Errors:** TCP segment reassembly issues.
- **Application Protocol (Layer 5):** HTTP, FTP, SMB, etc. (Application layer).
- **Application Data:** Application-specific data.

---

## Packet Navigation

- `Go -> Go to Packet`: Jump to a specific packet number.
- `Edit -> Find Packet`: Search packet contents or events.

### Effective Searching Requires:

- **Input Type:** Display Filter, Hex, String, Regex  
- **Search Field:** Packet List, Packet Details, Packet Bytes

---

## Mark Packets

- Right-click to mark/unmark packets.
- Marked packets **are not saved** after the session.

---

## Packet Comments

- Right-click a packet to add a comment.  
- Comments **are saved** if the session is saved.

---

## Export Packets

Use this to narrow down your analysis.

- Go to `File -> Export Specified Packets`

---

## Export Objects

Wireshark can extract files transferred over the network (for supported protocols).

- Go to `File -> Export Objects -> [File Type]`

---

## Time Display Format

By default, Wireshark shows time in seconds since capture start.  
To get more informative timestamps:

- `View -> Time Display Format -> UTC Date and Time`

---

## Expert Information

Groups protocol states to help identify issues quickly.

- Access via the **circle icon** in the bottom-left corner or `Analyze -> Expert Information`.

### Colour Indicators:

- **Blue:** Workflow information  
- **Cyan:** Notable events (e.g., application error codes)  
- **Yellow:** Unusual error codes or warnings  
- **Red:** Problems (e.g., malformed packets)

---

## Packet Filtering

- **Capture Filters:** Filter packets before capture.  
- **Display Filters:** Filter packets after capture (for viewing).

---

## Apply as Filter

Basic filtering method:

- Right-click a field (e.g., Source IP) → `Apply as Filter`  
- Or go to `Analyze -> Apply Filter`

---

## Conversation Filter

Enables more advanced filtering, such as packets with the same IP and specific ports.

---

## Colourise Conversation

Visually distinguishes related packets without applying a filter.

- Right-click or use `View -> Colourise Conversation`

---

## Prepare as Filter

Similar to "Apply as Filter", but allows editing before running:

- Right-click → `Prepare as Filter`  
- You can extend the filter with **AND/OR** conditions.

---

## Apply as Column

Add/remove columns to display more information:

- Right-click the column header or go to `Analyze -> Apply as Column`

---

## Follow Stream

Displays data as it appears at the application level.  
Useful for inspecting login data, credentials, and plain-text protocols.

- Right-click a packet or go to `Analyze -> Follow TCP/UDP/HTTP Stream`

### Stream Display:

- **Red:** Client  
- **Blue:** Server

> When following a stream, Wireshark applies a stream filter automatically.  
> To return to the full view, click the **X** on the filter bar.
